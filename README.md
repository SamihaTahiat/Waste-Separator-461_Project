# Waste-Separator-461_Project
The code for a sustainable waste separator system using arduino Uno.  
In this hardware project, the system detects and separates 3 kinds of waste(wet, dry and metal) using arduino uno as microcontroller. To detect the waste IR sensors,ultrasonic sensor, raindrop sensor and proximity sensors were used. Additionally, servo motor, stepper motor, buzzer, wheel, jumper wires were used to make the system functionable.
